👋 Hi, I’m @Anjani Naga Koteswari

👀 I’m interested in:
- Cloud Computing
- Artificial Intelligence
- Machine Learning
- Data Science

🌱 I’m currently learning:
- C++, Java with Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
-  Python for Scientific Computing
- Cloud-based AI/ML solutions

💻 My Projects:
**Money Mesh Navigator:**: A web-based expense tracker built using JavaScript, HTML, CSS with Chart.js for visualizations. This project focused on user experience and dynamic UI/UX design. Users can register, log in, track expenses, and visualize data through pie charts and bar charts. While no complex algorithms were involved, this project highlights front-end and back-end integration.
  
**Python Scientific Calculator:**: A Python-based calculator with advanced scientific functions. The project integrates libraries like NumPy and SymPy for handling complex computations such as trigonometric, logarithmic, and statistical functions.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
- AI and ML projects with a focus on practical cloud implementations.
- Developing data-driven solutions for personal finance.
